# The Peanuts Game

A little drag&drop game built in React to test your knowledge of the Peanuts gang. At each page load, 8 characters appear on the screen (randomly selected from the whole gang). You'll be rewarded with confetti if you get them all in the correct place!

Although the game itself is very straightforward, it has been an interesting little project!
